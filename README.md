# RusherHack GhoulMode Module

This allows you to stay in the world even after you die, the death screen is kind of "disabled" and
when you die you will still be able to see the world, but not interact with it. I dont know why but 
grim flags you when using movement modules such as Flight so use freecam for looking around.



Have fun :)
